# Lastly, update the Google Drive data folder. This is done using
# a rclone clientâ€“specifically the "copy" function, which scans
# both the source (local folder) and destination (remote folder)
# and uploads only the files that are new or have changed since
#the last synchronization. This means it doesn't re-upload every
# existing file and, perhaps most importantly, means it CANNOT
# DELETE EXISTING FILES.
